The pictures show the same scene at the same time from two diffent perspectives: Two cubes on a ckeckerboard that are at rest relative to the observer while a point light source is running symmetrically throught the cubes with a speed of 0.9c. Doppler and searchlight effect were neglected to simplify the scene.

The shadows of the cubes appears curved and asymmetrical due to the light travel time effect and the shape of the shadows depends on the perspective.

Visible effects: Light travel time effect, analogue of the Doppler effect in geometry.
