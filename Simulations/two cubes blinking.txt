Two cubes on a ckeckerboard are at rest relative to the observer while a blinking point light source is running symmetrically throught the cubes with a speed of 0.9c. Doppler and searchlight effect were neglected to simplify the scene.The stripes in front of blinking light source are very thin, which is the exact geometrical analogue to the relativistic Doppler effect (that would shorten the light wavelengths in this area).
