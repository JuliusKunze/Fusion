The video shows the view of an acclerated observer in space. The obsrever would measure an acceleration of 0.1c/s. 1000 randomly placed stars (with equal radius) are modeled with an infinite distance to the observer (very far away). A panel below the observer is for orientation only.

All relativistic effects are taken into account.
